<p>
  A page with a randomly selected AI poems. The poems are all human-curated, but LLM-Generated. Humans prompted, prodded, and refined the poem creation significantly. Don't worry, poets, your job is still safe.
</p>
<p>The only reason this project is interesting, in my opinion, is knowing that the poems are generated by (mostly) ChatGPT, and that it does a pretty bad job. By and large, it produces terrible poems. This project collects the best of many uninteresting attempts.</p>
  <p>I want to be clear: these poems are bad. Understanding why is perhaps a nice introductory exercise in understanding poetry.</p>
